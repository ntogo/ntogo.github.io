CSPC 120A/L Spring 2024

I'm a computer science major at CSUF. Originally transferred here for Psychology but found a new interest in comp sci. I expect to graduate around 2028(hopefully sooner!).

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 9, Part 2
  I enjoyed this lab because in general, I liked making programs that had user input interactivity. This was one of the programs that had us create a guessing game that could be used with two people. I also found it unique as it required two separate programs working in tandem. I thought this was interesting because this was around the time we were first introduced to <fstream> and its functionality.

* Lab 10
  This was my second favorite lab because this was the first time we had put to use a 2D vector. I was interested in this concept because I could see how it could be used in other things such as position in a 2D space. As I was completing this lab with my partner, it made me think about how a 2D vector could be used in the context of a 2D videogame.

* Lab 11, Part 2
  Like Lab 9, this also included an interactive guessing game. The difference, however, was that we used a random number generator in this lab. Meaning it could be used by one user. I think it was a nice step up in terms of complexity from Lab 9. It was familiar but different in how we implemented guessing.
